## WebSocket / Real-Time API

Transport is **Socket.IO**, mounted at the root path (`/`) on the same host and port as REST, and is **websocket only** (no polling fallback).

Authenticate on connect with a JWT via `auth: {{ token }}` in the Socket.IO client:

```javascript
import {{ io }} from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io({connect_target}, {{
  transports: ["websocket"],
  auth: {{ token: "<JWT>" }},
}});
```

- Fallback: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header.
- Fallback: `?token=<JWT>` query string.

**Events:** Client emits `subscribe_hypothesis` and `subscribe_analysis`; server emits `task_update` and `analysis_update`. See the [full event/payload reference](TODO_LINK).
